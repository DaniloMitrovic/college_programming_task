# college_programming_task
In architectural college we learn basics of programming so this is a quick way for me to have my work wherever.


Summary:>
  -> Build a simple camera that will show an object passed trough it ( in this case a box shape )
  -> Build it with the least amount of objects necesery ( for cube/boxy box )|
  -> asign moveability with camera via standard 3ds max mouse navigation


// basis
  -> camera , object:
    basic frame dimensions 
    basic focal length
    basic pixel to unit convertions
    background and stuff
   
  -> point [ pnt_]
    i,j,k default vectors
    some basic arithmetics
    some failed comparisons ( euclidean and axial comparison are too complicated to be able to work with overwritten sort function )
    -> comparison order moved to vectors

  -> box [ b_box ]
    i,j,k dimensioning ( origin is center ) to help with rotation and projection stuff
    
  -> plane work in progress
  -> vector work in progress
